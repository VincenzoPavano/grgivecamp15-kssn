                            The notion of bringing services into schools is not new; the idea has been around since the
                            turn
                            of the century, when settlement house workers used the concept to help meet the needs of the
                            influx of immigrants pouring into cities at the time, led by people like Jane Addams and
                            John
                            Dewey. Also, in the mid-1930s, "lighted schoolhouses" opened in Flint, Michigan, which used
                            empty school buildings at night for student and family programming. These schools, overseen
                            by
                            Charles S. Mott and Frank Manley, are often referred to as the earliest model for today's
                            community schools. Today, hundreds of community schools exist all over the country!

                            In 2006, the Kent School Services Network began its work in eight pilot schools. The KSSN
                            initiative was led by the Kent County Family and Children's Coordinating Council. The
                            Council
                            had conducted extensive research on school reform and integrated service delivery efforts
                            around
                            the country – including visiting a Children’s Aid Society community school in New York City.
                            The
                            Council collaborated with key community partners, including county government, local
                            foundations, county agencies, local healthcare organizations, the Kent ISD, and the United
                            Way.
                            The Children’s Aid Society and the National Center for Community Schools continued to
                            provide
                            technical assistance and training to KSSN for its first seven years of operation.

                            In the 1990s, the Kent County Department of Human Services and local companies undertook a
                            strategic examination of dual generational poverty to uncover barriers associated with
                            achieving
                            financial independence and family stability. One of the solutions identified by this study
                            was
                            to place DHS caseworkers in companies. This resulted in employees showing up for work
                            consistently and on time, and successfully transitioning off welfare support. The success of
                            this intervention was what led to the introduction of DHS staff into KSSN schools, and it
                            strengthened KSSN’s commitment to public-private partnerships.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Kent County DHS staff members have been working in the KSSN schools since the very
                            beginning. By
                            placing human services staff in the schools, families are able to access social services
                            there
                            rather than at the county office. DHS staff members, titled Family Independence Specialists,
                            provide the professional guidance, support and interventions needed to help families move
                            toward
                            financial independence. Family Independence Specialists get to know the parents and their
                            children, and strong relationships are formed within the school setting. This increases
                            parental
                            involvement, as parents become more comfortable in the schools, and feel supported by
                            another
                            adult helping them navigate the welfare system as well as the education system.

                            KSSN also works closely with network180, the community mental health authority for Kent
                            County.
                            In 2010, network180 received a $6 million federal grant which allowed KSSN to expand and
                            place
                            mental health professionals in all schools, and offer behavioral health services year-round.
                            Three local mental health agencies began staffing Site Team Clinicians in the KSSN schools
                            to
                            provide screenings, outpatient and home-based therapy, and prevention groups. These three
                            agencies were also responsible for hiring KSSN Community School Coordinators.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As it has expanded, KSSN has utilized a targeted universalism approach to reduce the
                            inequities
                            and disparities for the most vulnerable students in the Kent County area. In 2013, the KSSN
                            Leadership Team began working on building administrative, governance, and sustainability
                            capacity to support the infrastructure of KSSN, and recommended a structure and governance
                            redesign for the organization. On February 1, 2014, the community school coordinators became
                            employees of the new KSSN entity. KSSN went from being an initiative run largely out of the
                            executive's director's kitchen to a formal 501(c)3 nonprofit. As of the beginning of the
                            2014-15
                            school year, KSSN partners with nearly 30 schools in eight school districts, serving 18,000
                            students from Pre-K through 12th grade.
